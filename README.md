# kber: Estimate the Strength of the Magnitude Effect

## The magnitude effect
Researchers often assume that animals can choose the largest patch of food or the most attractive mate. All these decisions involve assessing the magnitude of multiple stimuli (ie. the magnitude of a quality, such as length, brightness or mass), and discriminating between these magnitudes.

Intuitively, the ease of discriminating two stimuli depends on the absolute distance between the two magnitudes. If the difference is very small, then the two stimuli will be indistinguishable. This is called the "distance effect". However, often it is not absolute differences which are important, but relative differences. When trying to discriminate the length of two pencils, for example, it may be possible to determine which one is larger if the size difference is only a centimetre. However, it would be very difficult to discriminate the length of two tables which are a centimetre apart in length. This example shows that the magnitude of both stimuli, as well as the distance between them, affects our ability to discriminate. This is called the "magnitude effect".

The distance effect and the magnitude effect can be linked together by this equation:
$$\text{stimulus contrast} = \frac{ΔI}{I^k}$$
where stimulus contrast is a measure of the perceived difference between two stimuli, *ΔI* is the **distance** between the stimuli, and *I* is the stimulus **magnitude**.

In this equation, *k* is a measure of the strength of the magnitude effect. If $k=0$, stimulus magnitude has no effect on discrimination; only the distance betwen stimuli matters. The larger *k* is, the stronger the magnitude effect.

**Note:** How should the stimulus magnitude *I* be measured, when there are two stimuli? Historically, studies usually take *I* to be the smaller magnitude of the pair. Some studies (eg. Nachev et al. 2013) have taken *I* to be the mean magnitude of both stimuli. Depending on the experiment, one of the stimuli in the pair may have a stronger claim to being the "background" or "reference" stimulus, in which case this stimulus can be used as *I* (eg. Dixit et al. 2022).
